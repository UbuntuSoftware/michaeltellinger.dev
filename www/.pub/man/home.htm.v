         # Marketing
         The Anon framework is a tiny-yet-powerful - multi-purpose PHP framework.
         This "framework" is merely a "boilerplate" done in a way that makes it easy to use and extend.
         The name and logo suggests "anonymity", but has no affiliation with the "anonymous political
         movement" at all -and the branding (name & logo) is not trade-marked in any way.
         The reason for this name is to promote a "white label" product which you can re-brand and sell as
         your own work - for any business.

         The lisencing of Anon prohibits selling it as you bought it.
         You have to at least change the name and logo.
         From here on you can tailor it for use in specific business industries. You can then sell your
         work as your own product.

         Anon comes in 3 licences:
            0) free trial 30 days - online only !!!

            1) Basic
            You can use it for your own business, as a web application development platform.

            2) Developer
            You can extend it any way you like and sell to any number of businesses -royalty free.

            3) Reseller
            Change the name and logo and sell it as your own product to anyone, this is automated and can
            be done & downloaded as your own product on the Anon website.


         # Technology
         The host system Anon is meant for a typical LAMP setup, as it is a PHP framework.
         If your workstation's operating system is not Linux, you can use VirtualBox for this.

         Even though Anon is a small framework, it is geared towards simplicity and rapid development.
         After installing it, you'll notice the `docroot` folder is uncluttered as its
         "core files" are hidden-files. You can view the hidden files of course, but you don't have to.

         In the `docroot` is where you create new folders for each main section of your project.
         The  `index.html` sym-link is just there for "graceful fail" in case your apache or PHP config is
         incompatible with this framework.

         From this "clean slate" you can create folders, each of which represents a "class" (tree).
         When you create a folder in the docroot, Anon handles it as a "tree node" and inside this folder
         You can create files & folders -each of which represents attributes of the tree.

         When you've created a folder in the `docroot`, you can navigate to that folder in your web
         browser. If your config is in `DEVL` (development) mode you will see it created a tree-class PHP
         file, and a config file, each filled with some contents you may need.
